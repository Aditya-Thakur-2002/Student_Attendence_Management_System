# Student Attendance Management System with Face Recognition

This project integrates **Face Recognition** and **Generative AI** to provide an innovative solution for managing student attendance efficiently. It utilizes **OpenCV**, **MTCNN**, and facial expression recognition to detect faces, mark attendance, and analyze student engagement.

## Features
- **Face Recognition-Based Attendance**
- **Emotion Recognition for Engagement Analysis**
- **Sentiment-Based Attendance Tracking**
- **User-Friendly Interface with Navigation Features**

## Current Status
This project is incomplete and under active development. Upcoming updates will include:
- Chatbot integration for user assistance.
- Fixes for issues with linking face data for attendance.
- Enhanced emotion analytics and insights.

## Database Structure
The system uses a MySQL database with a `student_details` table containing fields like `Department`, `Course`, `Student_ID`, `Student_Name`, `Photo_Status`, etc.

### Example SQL Commands
- **Create Table:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE student_details (
      Department VARCHAR(50),
